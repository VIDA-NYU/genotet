<h3> Manage the Views </h3>
<ul>
<li>Type commands in the console to create and modify views. Or, you can use the shortcuts in the menu.
</li>
<li>Views are treated as objects. The method
    <pre>createView(string viewname, string viewtype)</pre>
    returns a view object that can be manipulated. For example,
    <pre>createView("myNetwork", "graph").loadData("th17", "^BATF3$")</pre>
    creates a view named "myNetwork" of type "graph", and load the genes that matched the regular expression "^BATF3$".
  Menu equivalent: Menu -> Panel -> Create View
</li>
<li>To access a view object after creation, use
    <pre>getView(string viewname)</pre>
    This also returns a view object, and you may concatenate it with loadData.
</li>
<li>To close a view, use
    <pre>closeView(string viewname)</pre>
  You can also click the close button at the top-right of each view.
</li>
<li>Certain types of views can be linked to another. 
For example, a "histogram" view may listen to a "graph" view so as to load the histogram of selected node in graph.
To link two views, use
    <pre>linkView(sourceViewname, targetViewname)</pre>
  Menu equivalent: Menu -> Panel -> Link Views
  You can also left-click the SendMessage button at the top-left of each view (wifi icon).
</li>
<li>To unlink two linked views, use
    <pre>unlinkView(sourceViewname, targetViewname)</pre>
  Menu equivalent: Menu -> Panel -> Unlink Views
  You can also left-click the GetMessage button at the top-left of each view (signal strength icon).
  Right-clicking the SendMessage button unlinks the view and all of its listeners.
  Right-clicking the GetMessage button unlinks the view and its listening view.
</li>
<li>Views can be grouped together. The grouped views will move and resize together.
For certain type of views such as histograms, grouping can also synchronize their ranges.
To group two views, use
    <pre>groupView(sourceViewname, targetViewname)</pre>
  Menu equivalent: Menu -> Panel -> Group Views
  You can also left-click the Group button at the top-left of each view (double window icon).
  Right-clicking the Group button let the view quit from its current group.
</li>
<li>
  When you hover on the SendMessage button, the listeners of the current view will be highlighted.
  When you hover on the GetMessage button, the view that is being listened by the current view will be highlighted.
  When you hover on the Group button, the views that are in the same group as the current view will be highlighted.
</li>
<li>Drag the header to move a view. Drag the bottom-right corner to resize a view. Click the buttons on the header to close/minimize views.
When a view is minizied, the UI bar will be hidden.
</li>
<li>Click anywhere in a view to move it to the front. Double-click the view to hide/show its header.
</li>
<li>Some views may create affiliated table views automatically.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='graph'> Graph View </h3>
<ul>
<li>The graph view is for showing the biochemical network. 
First, focus at some genes using regular expressions. 
The genes that are neighbors of the focused genes will be shown in the network.
</li>
<li>The loadData function takes two parameters
    <pre>loadData(string net, string exp)</pre>
    where "net" is the network name, and "exp" is a regular expression. All the genes with a name that matches the expression will be focused, 
    and their neighbors will be shown in the graph. * Currently only "th17" is supported as "net".
</li>
<li>Hover the edges and nodes of the graph to view detailed information. Click on nodes to view its incident edges. See table view for more details.
</li>
<li>Drag nodes to modify the graph layout.
</li>
<li>Use mouse wheel on background to zoom. Drag the background to translate.
</li>
<li>You can select either an edge or a node in the graph, which will be highlighted in orange. 
Selected element will be reflected in the graph's listener histograms, if there exists any.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='histogram'>Histogram View</h3>
<ul>
<li>The histogram view is for showing the binding data.
Name a gene and its chromosome number to load its binding data.
You may also load data via interacting with the histogram's listening graph.
</li>
<li>The loadData function takes two parameters
    <pre>loadData(string genename, string chr)</pre>
    where "genename" is the name of the gene, "chr" is the number of the chromosome. "chr" is optional, and is by default "1".
</li>
<li>Select desired chromosome number to switch chromosome.
</li>
<li>At the middle there is an overview of the histogram. You may frame select a focused region (shown in light blue).
</li>
<li>Below the main histogram there is a zoom bar. Drag a region to focus.
</li>
<li>Drag the main histogram to translate it. Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out.
</li>
<li>When the histogram is listening to a graph, it will automatically load the binding data of the selected gene in the graph. 
If the selected element of the graph is an edge (a,b), it will load the binding data of "a" and locate gene "b" within the binding data.
</li> 
</ul>

<h3 id='heatmap'>Heatmap View</h3>
<ul>
<li>The heatmap view is used for showing the heatmap of an expression matrix and plot expression data for some genes as polylines.
</li>
<li>To add a gene to the polyline plot, use regexp in the "Plot" input box. To remove a polyline, right click the legend color box. The plot now supports a maximum of 8 polylines.
</li>
<li>To add/select/remove gene rows, use add/sel/rm regexp in the "Gene" input box. You can also type a regexp only, and it would be equivalent as sel regexp.
</li>
<li>To add/select/remove condidtion colomns, use add/sel/rm regexp in the "Cond" input box. You can also type a regexp only, and it would be equivalent as sel regexp.
<li>If AutoScale is on, the gradient will automatically match the min/max values for the selected region of the heatmap</li>
<li>Adjust the resolution to obtain finer details of the heatmap (finder resolution increase processing and network burden)</li>
</li>
<li>You can drag a box in the heatmap and zoom in.
</li>
<li>If a heatmap view is listening to a graph view, each time a node is clicked in the graph, the heatmap will load the genes that are targets of the clicked node 
into the heatmap. It will also add the clicked gene to the polyline plot.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='table'>Table View</h3>
<ul>
<li>The table view is used for showing list of multi-dimensional variables.
Currently it is mainly for showing the incident edges of a node in the network.
</li>
<li>Click on the header of each column to sort the items by that attribute.
</li>
<li>The table view has a selection list. You can toggle the selected elements, by directly clicking them.
Alternatively, you can use the filter. The filter supports simple query syntax:
<pre>attribute operator value</pre>
Three terms must be separated by spaces.
"attribute" is one of the attribute name as shown in a column header. 
"operator" is one of {<, <=, >, >=, =}.
"value" is number or string where applied.
After typing in the filter command, click either "sel" or "desel" to select or deselect items.
"sel" adds the matched items to the selection list, 
while "desel" removes the matched items from the selection list.
If the filter is empty, "sel" and "desel" by default selects/deselects all items.
</li>
<li>
For example, to show all the items with weight between [1.5, 1.9], 
first use command "weight >= 1.5" and "sel", and then use command "weight > 1.9" and "desel".
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='menu'>Menu View</h3>
<ul>
<li>The menu view provides global information and interface to shortcut operations. To create a menu, use 
<pre>createMenu()</pre>
You can create at most one menu.
</li>
<li>The "View Panel" provides shortcuts to command line operations, including create, link/unlink, group views, close all views.
</li>
<li>The "Preset Layout" provides some preset layouts for known tasks, so as to get a quick startup.
</li>
<li>The "System Option" contains checkboxes to turn on/off auxiliary features. Silent: do not pop up alerts. Hint: hover on input area or button to
view its usage.
</li>
</ul>
